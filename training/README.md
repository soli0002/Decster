# Instructions

The first script to run is `generate_data_with_spaces.py`, and then `generate_data_without_spaces.py`.
This is because `generate_data_without_spaces.py` is set to append to the training file by default, and running `generate_data_with_spaces.py` first will result in overwriting the original data written by the other script
